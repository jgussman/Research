SOSA2 
-Need to add in the functionality that allows the user to put in a whole binary file and then pick the wavelengths you want to look at.
-Right now I am assuming the observed has more decimal places than the SS. This could cause a problem
-Display the observed

-******critical error. If The dealta lambda is not at least to the 3 decimal place or the 3rd decimal place is a zero the program fails. For some reason it fails for temps 5800-6000K 
-I should add an opition if you would like to use all of the files

-Need to add somewhere which column is what for the ascii files 

-The files that through the exceptions is:
6000K 


-HIP94034
-I'm staying the seperation of the two stars for HIP94034 is 3.591 angstroms
-adding 0.35 to the observed wavelength so they ***mathch up***


--IDEA:
Make a file where the user changes all the parameters in a txt file. then they dont have to be continually prompted stuff
