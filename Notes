SOSA2 
-Need to add in the functionality that allows the user to put in a whole binary file and then pick the wavelengths you want to look at.
-Right now I am assuming the observed has more decimal places than the SS. This could cause a problem
-Display the observed
-I'm staying the seperation of the two stars for HIP94034 is 3.641 angstroms
-******critical error. If The dealta lambda is not at least to the 3 decimal place or the 3rd decimal place is a zero the program fails

-HIP94034
-adding ____ to all the wavelengths so they ***mathch up***
