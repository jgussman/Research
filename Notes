SOSA2 
-Need to add in the functionality that allows the user to put in a whole binary file and then pick the wavelengths you want to look at.
-Right now I am assuming the observed has more decimal places than the SS. This could cause a problem
-Display the observed

-******critical error. If The dealta lambda is not at least to the 3 decimal place or the 3rd decimal place is a zero the program fails. For some reason it fails for temps 5800-6000K 
-I should add an opition if you would like to use all of the files

-Need to add somewhere which column is what for the ascii files 

-The files that through the exceptions is:
6000K 



-HIP94034
-I'm staying the seperation of the two stars for HIP94034 is 3.591 angstroms
-adding 0.35 to the observed wavelength so the observed matches the SS
-(1/6/2020) The 3D plot shows that it is possible for there to a better pair a temp of 7000. 
    -2 Things on this: 
        -The 7000 pair for g+4.2_z+0.00_vt1 introduces new lines into the spectra that are not at all present in the observed. Also the lines become much much stronger in comparison to 
         teff of 6900
        -Even though the first best pair is l6500 and r6800 when the pairs are made in an incredments of 1 (instead of 0.1) the second best pair is l6400 r6900. 




--IDEA:
Make a file where the user changes all the parameters in a txt file. then they dont have to be continually prompted stuff

--For the Read Me 
-SOSA assumes there is a header in both the Ascii and Excel File
